<span class="titletext">Rostering by Business Rules</span>





<P>
Wombat Rosterer is an application that allows the user to manipulate <span class="NDO">Worker</span>s and their <span class="NDO">RosterSlot</span>s, and then generate rosters based on these manipulations. A <span class="NDO">RosterSlot</span> provides a rule as to how a <span class="NDO">Worker</span> is to be rostered. There are many <span class="NDO">RosterSlot</span>s for each <span class="NDO">Worker</span>. Together these rules describe how a <span class="NDO">Worker</span> will be slotted into any monthly rosters that are generated. Using the supplied data any generated roster will come out with every night being filled. Some examples of rules that can be created are:
<ul>
<li>
Saturday dinner shift on the third Monday of every month except December
</li>
<li>
Particular dinner shift on 22nd April
</li>
<li>
NOT to do a shift at all on 22nd April
</li>
<li>
Overnight shift every two weeks, where the first ever shift was on 5th November 2004
</li>
</ul>

The rest of this short manual is task driven, and thus each heading can be thought of as its own <em>How To</em>.
