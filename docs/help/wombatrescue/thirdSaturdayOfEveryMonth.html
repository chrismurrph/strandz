<span class="titletext">Set Naba to work the third Saturday of every month only</span>

Go to the <span class="SCN">Roster Slots</span> tab. Naba has only one roster slot anyway so we can alter it. Click the <span class="SCN">Monthly Restart</span> checkbox and set the <span class="SCN">Week In Month</span> to be the third.
