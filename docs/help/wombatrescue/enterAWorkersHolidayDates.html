<span class="titletext">Enter a Worker's holiday dates</span>
<P>
Two 'unavailability periods' can be entered for each <span class="DO">Worker</span>. See <span class="SCN">Away 1 Start</span> and the other date fields nearby. You must specify both a start and an end date. If you don't specify both then record validation kicks in when you try to navigate to another <span class="DO">Worker</span>. It is impossible to roster someone during one of their unavailability periods.
