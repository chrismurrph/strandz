<span class="titletext">Generate this month's roster</span>
<P>
<span class="SCN">Roster/THIS - <em>Month Name</em></span>. You need to change <span class="DO">Worker</span>s and their <span class="DO">RosterSlot</span>s to do the job of filling a roster. If you just tab to an already generated roster then re-generation does not take place. When you have made changes and you want to see the results of those changes in a roster then you need to <span class="SCN">[Save]</span> and select the roster from the menu.
