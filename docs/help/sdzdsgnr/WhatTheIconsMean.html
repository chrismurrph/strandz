A <code>StemAttribute</code> is one that has the potential to become any other type of Attribute. It is associated with a DO field but is not yet bound to an item.

A <code>FieldAttribute</code> that has been bound to a field (rather than a table) item.

A <code>TableAttribute</code> that has been bound to a table (rather than a field) item.

A <code>FieldAttribute</code> that was previously bound to a field item, but is now no longer associated with an item. In this case you should delete the attribute or set it back to be a StemAttribute. This  situation can only be arrived at by doing something unknown to the Designer. For example removing a TextField control and then importing its panel (by pressing the <span class="SCN">Update</span> button). If for instance you did something within the Designer such as removing the panel then the attributes would all change to be StemAttributes.

A <code>TableAttribute</code> that was previously bound to a table item.

A <code>ReferenceLookupAttribute</code> does not bind to an item but represents a lookup link from one DO to another. Having a DO field behind this attribute means that the DO can be 'sucked into' the current <code>Node</code>, and thereafter more <code>StemAttributes</code> will be available for binding.

A <code>ReferenceLinkAttribute</code> can be thought of as representing the 'foreign key' column of the detail table in a Master/Detail relationship between two DOs. As far as the relationship between DOs goes it is the same as a <code>ReferenceLookupAttribute</code>, but it is used to say 'all the DO items that are in the list that I am part of that refer to the same DO that I do are the details of the DO master'.

A <code>CollectionLinkAttribute</code> is also used for a Master/Detail relationship, but one where the master DO has a list of the collection DO.
