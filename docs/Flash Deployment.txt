Play swf, vod2

Remote Server Start:

cd /opt/adobe/fms
./fmsmgr adminserver start
./fmsmgr server fms start
net

General:

rtmp://localhost/vod2/Blah.flv

Need to produce a .flv for the server

For the client the example html -> javascript -> vodtest.swf
vodtest.swf is the page that we are entering the url of [rtmp://www.strandz.org/vod2/Blah.flv]
You can't see this link unless you are in Adobe Flash.

http://www.onyxservers.com requires .flv files - gave good description of how it all works

HOWTO Make a ProdKPIs.html:

Record AVI (use DivX not XviD) to C:/Screen Recordings
Test in RealPlayer
  Convert to MWV using AVS Video Converter
  Upload MWV file to Video Desk
  Check that name used is the same as the name used by video.html
Use http://www.flvencoder.com/ to make a FLV file, and double-click to test 
Ftp to FLVHosting host (/httpdocs/movies directory)
Copy a .fla file (with right dimensions) before starting Adobe Flash

rtmp://72.35.95.20/seaweed/

Make that file name the source in Adobe Flash [rtmp://72.35.95.20/seaweed/ProdKPIs2.flv]
Ftp two files (.html and SWF) to Tomcat ($TOMAPPS/flash) directory
mv ProdKPIs4.html ProdKPIs4Actual.html and make ProdKPIs.html use the detection script:
vi ProdKPIs.html
i, and copy C:\sdz-zone\docs\indexflash.html (or C:\sdz-zone\docs\ClientSideDetection.html) into it, making sure it calls on ProdKPIs4Actual.html
/etc/init.d/tomcat5.5 restart
Watch demo from http://www.strandz.org/flash/ProdKPIs.html 

FLA Encoding difficulties:
(alternatively FLV Encoder with max bitrate is as good as any - but is smaller (800*640) and blurs a bit)
(Flix might be another option but doesn't seem to like any .avi file I use [support on it])
(The Flash Encoder cannot even start up!)
(Behind the scenes Riva VX is used, is based on http://blog.inlet-media.de/flvtool2/ - so we could download the source)
