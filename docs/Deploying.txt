Deploying production
--------------------
Commit and check emails to see all passed
Follow instruction (3) from StartupCayenne.java
Action / Clean DOs (cmd line from C:\sdz-zone-old\bin-jdo\clean.bat for old)
Compile from IDE
Action / Enhance DOs (cmd line C:\sdz-zone-old\bin-jdo\enhance.bat for old)
Test it out if can
ant -f jarStrandz.xml and jarWombat.xml (both from bin)
ftp them across from %SDZ%/lib-sdz to ~chris/scratch
- view-jar.sh wr-prod-properties.jar to make sure has right rosterer and right version (*)
- OR commit and ant jar-kodo-property-files (from $SP/wombatrescue) if want version number updated
$SDZ/bin/deployTeresaSpring.sh will collect them
Test the PROD application

(*)
Commit everything on client b4 ant will give correct version number when ant in next step
In $SP/wombatrescue chk wombat-prod.properties is what want then ant jar-kodo-property-files
ie. ant jar-kodo-property-files (from $SP/wombatrescue) must be done - or else the past version number will be used!

Deploying Memory
----------------
commit everything
pre-deploy.sh
all-sf.sh (all the calls to sf.sh can be commented out)
Test the MEMORY application

Deploying Memory - issue 1
--------------------------
Problem: Enhanced Worker.class making it thru
Useful to check size and date of wombat-memory.war
Can bring the war file onto the desktop to check if implements PersistentCapable
$SDZ/in-out/wombat-memory.war s/be result of pre-deploy.sh
Conclusion: Maybe chamges I made while looking at the problem fixed it - keep an eye...
