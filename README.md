# strandz
Strandz is a very high level UI framework. It has binding and controller aspects and works with Java Swing. 

A rostering application has been built with it, and used successfully for over a decade. If you need to roster people 
periodically (monthly best) onto shifts then this application makes it easy because the rostering is done by rules, so 
if you have enough people the rostering will be done mostly automatically - you will just have to take care of the
conflicts, by slightly altering each person's rules each month. An example of a rule is "overnight shift on the second 
Tuesday of every month".

Bring up sbt and type run. This should bring up a memory-only version of the rostering application.
